For reasons like:\n* lack of skills;\n* lack of tools; lack of confidence;\n* cultural.\n\nMany of the companies are not yet ready for the investment in AI thinking that it will commit a lot of people, time and money, but the author states that:\n> AI is about mass experimentation, not one big project implementation.

The importance of companies being confident when using AI tools.\n\nAbout current customers who use IBM services, he cites the most common use cases:\n![ the most common use cases, by industry](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Watson-Sketch-Rob-Thomas-800.png)\n\n\nYou can access the full [here](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2019/10/watson-anywhere-the-future/)."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.9", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.9.12", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
